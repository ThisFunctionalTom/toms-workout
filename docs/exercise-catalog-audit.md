# Liftosaur exercise mapping coverage

Catalog snapshot: 2026-09-24, from Liftosaur MCP `list_exercises`.
Garmin FIT profile: 21.214.0. Equipment variants count separately.
This report is generated from [the shared mappings](../shared/exercise-mappings.json)
and [the catalog snapshot](../tests/liftosaur-exercises.json).

| Decision | Built-in names |
| --- | ---: |
| exact | 173 |
| generic | 76 |
| category | 107 |
| unsupported | 8 |
| Total | 364 |

Every built-in name has an explicit decision. Exact and generic entries include
a Garmin category and subtype. Generic entries lose the detail stated below.
Category-only and unsupported entries may still display as Unknown in Garmin.
Unknown custom names also remain unknown; no fuzzy matching is used.

Defaults were checked against [Liftosaur exercise definitions](https://github.com/astashov/liftosaur/blob/master/src/models/exercise.ts).
FIT symbols are resolved by the .NET Garmin FIT SDK when FIT files are generated.
This validates FIT metadata, not Garmin Connect display behavior for every exercise.
